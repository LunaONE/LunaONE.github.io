# Expertise

## Projects

Our recent project experiences include the following types of products:

### Single Page Web Applications

Be it porting legacy-platform based applications from `Win32` or Flash or creating entirely new web applications from scratch: Our standards and the demands of the modern user require a diligent approach in order to be reliable, user-friendly, and consistent. In order to achieve this, we build on mature open-source projects such as [TypeScript](#TypeScript) and [React](#React) with a proven combination of sound architectural designs as well as permanent tool-driven checks of every component of the final product.

### Real-Browser Testing

A common weakness in today's quality assurance approaches in testing complex applications and games, is that extensive manual labor is lost on the ever same–and most of the time working–core functionality, while newly developed and advanced features only get what's left of the time budget. We alleviate this pain by providing the necessary tools and expertise to fully test any application without human intervention. As a result your QA team can focus on the areas where the feel is equally important to the functionality or where it's economically unwise to automate.

### Scraping

The publicly accessible web contains a trove of valuable information for anyone. We help businesses acquire and explore information regarding customer demand and competitor offerings and bring them into a structured form for their business development analytics.

### Business-specific Content Management Systems

Many internal business processes are based on clerical data entry, update and retrieval. Be it a custom CRM system or inventory management tool, often times access to these is convoluted compared to standard software and therefore valuable insights are not gained from their data. By developing custom, workflow-based user interfaces we have helped several clients to speed up their processes and given them the tools to extract knowledge from the existing data.

## Technologies

These are the top 3 technologies we're recently and actively using:

### TypeScript

Probably the most important advancement for the development of JavaScript based application in the recent years, TypeScript gives developers the tools to prove many parts about the correctness of their programs without even running them. This creates a speedier development process as well as providing confidence during importance software maintenance tasks such as refactoring.

### React

Facebook's React has become the dominant view layer for managing user interface on the client. With the right set of supporting libraries (we have made great experiences with a Flux-like architecture in combination with FRP), this allows one to create nimble frontends which are easy to evolve and grow over time.

### Canvas Based Rendering (CreateJS, ThreeJS)

Sometimes `HTML`-based interfaces just can't deliver the specific requirements of bespoke application and game designs. In those circumstances we resort to custom-built rendering which allows us to create anything that can be expressed in pixels.

## Open Source

Often time's small-scale open-source projects get utilized in our clients' products and applications because they solve an immediate problem to a large degree. After a while though, we often find that some specific requirements are unmet, be it the ability to further customize the tool or delivering great performance in the specific environment. In those cases we aim to work together with the open source project maintainer's in order to improve the tool for our clients' needs as well as the broader community.
