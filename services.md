## Approach

Our usual process is split into 3 distinct steps, each building on top of the previous one:

1. The first step is always to start developing in the project at hand. This allows us to get to know the team and the project's technical architecture as well as gaining in-depth knowledge of the product being built. During this time we will help solving the most pressing engineering challenges and ensure that the projects stays on track or gets on it.
2. Upon leaving a project, we like to give feedback and tips beyond the technical challenges and observations of the last few months if needed. This includes process observations, discussion of possible future directions, and training employees to take over any previous implementation work if necessary.
3. If desired, we provide in-house tools as well as maintenance and hosting for them if the client does not have the capacity or resources to keep them up themselves. This allows the client to externalize tasks which are not part of the day-to-day operations and hence focus on their core business.
